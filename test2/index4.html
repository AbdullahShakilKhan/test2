    <h1> <u>Most Beautiful Valley In Pakistan</u></h1>
    <h2>4. Phander Valley</h2>
    <img src="phander.jpg" alt="phander">
    <p>Phander Lake, located in Phander Village, is almost too good to be true. The teal-coloured lake sits silently
        amongst light-green trees befitting a landscape painting.

        Despite being insanely beautiful, Phander Lake doesn’t see anywhere as close to the number of tourists as the
        more popular Attabad Lake does. During the 4 days I spent in Phander relaxing lakeside, I didn’t encounter any
        other tourists. If you do visit, I highly recommend you stay at the Lake Inn, which is a short walk away and
        charges 1,000 rupees per night.</p>
