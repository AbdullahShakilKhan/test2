    <h1> <u>Most Beautiful Valley In Pakistan</u></h1>
    <h2>3. Yarkhun Valley</h2>
    <img src="yarkhun.jpg" alt="yarkhun">
    <p>Though it’s relatively unheard of and forgotten compared to Pakistan’s most famous tourist spots, I think Yarkhun
        Valley was the most beautiful place I visited in the country. Located in the Upper Chitral district of Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa, Yarkhun dazzles with its mountain ranges and untouched villages.

        Reaching the valley, which stretches for many kilometres past the administrative town of Mastuj, requires a bit
        of effort if you don’t have your own vehicle. If you do have one though, the ride isn’t too bad – just prepare
        for mostly dirt roads!

        The side valley of Gazin is most definitely worth a detour if you make it all the way to Yarkhun. Here, you can
        see the mountains of the Thoi Pass, a high-altitude pass that connects Upper Chitral with Yasin Valley in Gilgit
        Baltistan.</p>
