    <h1> <u>Most Beautiful Valley In Pakistan</u></h1>
    <h2>5. Broghil Valley</h2>
    <img src="broghil.jpg" alt="broghil" width="50%">
    <p>Located way up north very close to Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor, Broghil Valley was formerly only accessible via
        trek or horseback. These days, the once-hidden locale can be reached by a treacherous jeep track – yet it still
        only receives a handful of visitors during the few months it’s not frozen under heaps of snow. Currently,
        whether or not foreigners are allowed to visit Broghil is iffy. (If you’re insistent, make sure you check with
        the Deputy Commissioner’s Office in Chitral before making the trek up there.) But Pakistanis – please go see
        this beauty! The valley is home to numerous high-altitude lakes, yaks, and sprawling green pastures, all set
        against a dramatic mountainous backdrop that soars above 13,000 feet.</p>
